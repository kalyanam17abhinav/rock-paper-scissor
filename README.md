Hello, i have created a interactive rock paper scissor game using html, css and javascript.
<br>
This uses basic html tags and css styling.

It uses javascript Math.random method to generate the coomputer's choice and user enters his choice by selecting any one of the three options, and if the user wins, it is diplayed in the message box on the screen.
